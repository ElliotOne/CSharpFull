Delegate vs Method Calls
-----------------------

- A method call directly invokes a specific function.
- A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that can reference one or more methods.
- Delegates provide flexibility by allowing methods to be assigned and called dynamically.
- However, delegate calls typically have a slight overhead compared to direct method calls.
- Delegates are powerful for implementing callbacks, events, and designing extensible systems.

Summary:
- Direct method calls are generally faster.
- Delegates are more flexible and enable dynamic method invocation.
